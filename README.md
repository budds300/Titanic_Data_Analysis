# Titanic Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project aims to perform an analysis of the Titanic dataset using Jupyter Notebook. The Titanic dataset contains various information about passengers on the Titanic, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, survival status, etc. The analysis will involve exploring the dataset, cleaning the data, performing feature engineering, and building a linear regression model to predict ticket fares.

## Setup Instructions

To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, install the required dependencies by running:

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook**: Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in the terminal:

4. **Open the Notebook**: Once Jupyter Notebook starts, navigate to the project directory and open the `Titanic_Data_Analysis.ipynb` notebook.

5. **Execute the Notebook**: Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Analysis Details

The analysis is divided into several sections:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the Titanic dataset and explore its structure and summary statistics.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values and performing necessary data transformations.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features, such as extracting titles from names and calculating family sizes.

4. **Missing Data Handling**: Fill missing values in the dataset, such as filling missing ages with the mean age of the corresponding title.

5. **Modeling**: Construct a linear regression model using statsmodels to predict ticket fares based on passenger attributes.

6. **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings and insights obtained from the analysis.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset using Jupyter Notebook. By following the setup instructions and executing the notebook, users can explore the dataset, perform data analysis, and build predictive models.
